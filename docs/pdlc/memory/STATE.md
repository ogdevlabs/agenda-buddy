## Active Blockers

- **⚠️ OPERATIONAL, HIGHEST RESIDUAL SEVERITY — rotate the `agenda_buddy` Atlas credential and review the cluster access log.** F-013 removed the credential from all tracked files, which does **not** remediate the disclosure: it remains in git history and stays valid until rotated at Atlas. Threat T-001 / PRD OQ-1. Merging F-013 does not close this. *(Raised by Phantom at Party Review — it was documented in four places but absent from the one list a handoff reader scans first.)*
- **F-013-T14 — AppHost end-to-end run unproven.** A container runtime is now available (Rancher Desktop), and attempt 1 got MongoDB + Kafka up and the dashboard serving with no exported env vars, but **the 7 service processes never launched** — DCP created 0 executablereplicasets for them and logged no error. `TargetPort` clearing and `WaitFor` gating were both ruled out by experiment. **Logged as `docs/issues/ISSUE-001-apphost-never-launches-services.md` (P1, must fix).** **Attempt 2 bisected it:** the dev-cert hypothesis is disproven, and the generic `AddProject<TProject>` overload is confirmed to create no DCP executable (proven side-by-side against the string-path overload, which works). A second blocker remains among {port clearing, WaitFor, parameter-backed WithEnvironment} — a known-good baseline and a 3-step bisection are recorded in the task. The committed AppHost still uses the broken overload, so **the fix is not yet applied**. Full detail and next steps in `docs/pdlc/tasks/F-013/F-013-T14.md`. Original blocker text: Five acceptance criteria (AC-1.1, AC-1.2, AC-1.3, AC-2.3, AC-3.4) plus observing threat T-004 in exported spans require the AppHost to actually provision MongoDB and Kafka. The build machine has neither `docker` nor `podman` installed, so they could not be verified and are recorded as BLOCKED rather than passing. Needs a human on a machine with Docker Desktop or Podman running. Everything else is attested in `docs/pdlc/design/aspire-wiring/verification.md`.
  *(The task store has no `blocked` status, so T-014 remains `open`; it is not startable work for an agent in this environment.)*
